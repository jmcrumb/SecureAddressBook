Per user log files
    Encryption key known by user
    Decryption key known by admin

    for files
        USER LOGS
            .log/<userid>/entries.log = the entries
            .log/<userid>/keys.log = the keyfile
            .log/nouser/entries.log = file for when no user signed in
        Admin stuff
            .log/admin/<userid>.key = the rsa key for each user, encrypted with admin encrypter
            .log/admin/

when user is created
    create keypair and save public with user, save private in .log/admin/<userid>.key
    create .log/<userid>/entries.log and .log/<userid>/keys.log

to read user log
    access private key of user who's log it is
    decrypt all keys for every log entry
    use those keys to undo AES encryption of entries
to save user log
    create random AES encryption key
    encrypt key with RSA and store in keyfile for user





- can read all user record
- can get private keys for each user decrypted using admin user decrypter function
- can get
